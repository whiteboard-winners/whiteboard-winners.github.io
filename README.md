Whiteboard Winners aims to be a community where all software developers can gain or sharpen their technical interviewing skills. We are a group of software developers collaborating to educate developers of all skill levels on best practices and strategies for solving technical whiteboarding questions, as well as practice answering technical questions curated by the members of the team. In a world where interview questions are extremely contrived and often very complex, we will work to empower everyone to succeed and demonstrate their skills as well as possible.
